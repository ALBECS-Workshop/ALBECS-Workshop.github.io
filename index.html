              <p>Working out more, reducing food waste, being kinder to others, ... - there are many behaviors people wish to change. Yet, while many behavior change applications have been developed to support people, users commonly do not adhere to these applications or abandon them entirely. To address the evident mismatch between what the applications offer and what users need, a variety of algorithmic approaches has been developed to adapt what the applications offer, when, how, and with whom. The term "algorithm" or "algorithmic approach" is thereby meant broadly to capture any computerized procedure for adapting behavior change support. These algorithmic approaches thereby draw from insights in areas such as nudging, persuasive technology, eCoaches, and conversational agents and use various algorithmic techniques from recommender systems to machine and reinforcement learning. Placing the human at the center and combining the strengths of humans and technology (i.e., augmented or hybrid intelligence) often is an important design guideline, as is accounting for ethical and societal values.</p>

                <p>This workshop brings together researchers, designers, developers, practitioners, and educators who are interested in the concept, development, evaluation, and impact of algorithmic behavior change support. Thus, while the Persuasive Technology conference considers all forms of technology, the focus of this workshop is on algorithms (e.g., based on logistic regression, reinforcement learning, recommender systems) that support behavior change. We are thereby interested in algorithms at both the macro level (i.e., which are part of behavior change applications) and the micro level (i.e., which support forms of behavior change as part of a technology that has a goal other than behavior change). We explicitly invite participants from various backgrounds such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, psychology, medical practice, and ethics of technology to contribute their perspectives and experiences. </p>
                <p>The broader objective of this workshop is to strengthen the community of people working on adaptive support for behavior change. To this end, the workshop aims to create a lively exchange of ideas that benefits both the current and future research of the individual workshop participants. Specifically, the workshop's aim is to a) learn about each other's work, b) jointly work on problems of the workshop participants, and c) establish a vision for future work on algorithmic behavior change support.</p>
				<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of possible topics in the context of algorithms for adaptive behavior change support:</p>

					<li>Application of algorithms in behavior change contexts (e.g., education, health, sustainability) </li>

				  Submissions to this workshop are in the form of papers describing both the authors' work and a problem that they would like to work on together with the other workshop participants. Working with other workshop participants on one's own problem is a unique opportunity to get input from a large number of experts. Examples include:
                </p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Questionnaire creation:</dt>
					<dd>-> creating question formulations in small groups, discussing if questions measure intended constructs</dd>
					<dt>Study design:</dt>
					<dd>-> getting feedback on one's draft experimental design for evaluating an algorithm</dd>
					<dt>Instructions for study:</dt>
					<dd>-> letting workshop participants follow an initial instruction set to see where they get stuck, which things are unclear, or which results they would get</dd>
					<dt>Applying design guidelines:</dt>
					<dd>-> after having developed design guidelines, asking workshop participants how they would apply the guidelines to their own research or how they (dis)agree with the guidelines</dd>
					<dt>Algorithm design:</dt>
					<dd>-> based on an initial algorithm idea, asking workshop participants for important concepts or guidelines to account for when further developing or implementing the algorithm</dd>
					<dt>Confirming guidelines for algorithm design:</dt>
					<dd>-> based on an initial set of guidelines one wants to use for one's algorithm design, asking workshop participants how they (dis)agree with these guidelines to establish community agreement</dd>
					<dt>Establishing codes for a thematic analysis:</dt>
					<dd>-> based on free-text responses providing feedback on an algorithm used in a previous study, asking workshop participants to in small groups come up with codes describing the concerns of study participants</dd>
					<dt>Establishing themes for a thematic analysis:</dt>
					<dd>-> based on codes describing the concerns of study participants about an algorithm, asking workshop participants to discuss possible themes</dd>

              <h3>Designing experiments <i>via</i> bandit algorithms: modeling considerations for better outcomes</h3>
              <p><b>Abstract.</b> The multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework holds great promise for designing adaptive experiments with outcomes and resource (e.g., cost, time, or sample size) benefits. For example, it can result in better participant outcomes <i>and</i> improved statistical power at the end of a trial. However, due to mathematical and computational aspects, most MAB variants have been developed and are implemented under binary or normal outcome models. In this talk, guided by three case studies we have designed, I will illustrate how traditional statistics can be integrated within this framework to enhance its potential. Specifically, I will focus on the most popular Bayesian MAB algorithm, Thompson sampling, and on two types of outcomes: (i) rating scales, increasingly common in recommendation systems, digital health and education, and (ii) zero-inflated data, characterizing mobile health experiments. Theoretical properties and empirical advantages in terms of balancing <i>exploitation</i> (outcome performance) and <i>exploration</i> (learning performance) will be presented. Further considerations will be provided in the unique and challenging case of small samples.</p>

              <h3>Human-Empowered Computer-Mediated Behavior Change</h3>
              <p><b>Abstract.</b> This talk will present a range of different applications and studies focused on behavior change in contexts such as incontinence and sleep disorders in children, ethical decision-making by cybersecurity professionals, adherence to treatment advice, reducing study stress, emotion regulation, and self-management of stroke recovery. Underlying the design of each application are principles ensuring that the application is evidence-based, empowering, empathic, and ethical. To achieve this, we will consider the process/workflow, components, use of knowledge bases as well as algorithms and dialogue templates, and adaptation to the user. The talk will conclude with a consideration of ethical issues in the design and use of such systems.</p>
              <p><b>Bio.</b> Deborah Richards is a Professor in the School of Computing at Macquarie University. Whilst working in the ICT industry, she completed a BBus (Comp and MIS) in 1989 and MAppSc (Info Studies) in 1995. Deborah completed a PhD in artificial intelligence on the reuse of knowledge at the University of New South Wales and joined academia in 1999. She is currently the Director of the Virtual Reality Laboratory and Director of Industry and External Relations for the School of Computing. She has been an artificial intelligence researcher since 1993, initially focused on the acquisition and reuse of knowledge and knowledge-based systems. In 2003, she moved to agent-based systems with a current emphasis on intelligent virtual agents and intelligent virtual worlds. The ethical use of these technologies has been a primary concern for over a decade. With 20 years in industry prior to joining academia, she is specifically interested in applying technology to improve current shortcomings and overcome barriers faced by stakeholders in education, training, health and well-being. She has over 400 refereed publications and over $5M in competitive external grant funding.</p>
